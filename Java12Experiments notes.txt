JDK 12 new features

    1. JEP 325: Switch Expressions (Preview)
        Motivation
            Extend the switch statement so that it can be used as either a statement or an expression, and that both
            forms can use either a "traditional" or "simplified" scoping and control flow behavior.

            several irregularities of the existing switch statement -- which have long been an irritation to users --
            become impediments. These include the default control flow behavior (fall through) of switch blocks, the
            default scoping of switch blocks (the block is treated as one single scope) and that switch works only as a
            statement, even though it is commonly more natural to express multi-way conditionals as expressions.

            For example, in the following code, the many break statements make it unnecessarily verbose, and this
            visual noise often masks hard to debug errors, where missing break statements mean that accidental
            fall-through occurs.
                switch (day) {
                    case MONDAY:
                    case FRIDAY:
                    case SUNDAY:
                        System.out.println(6);
                        break;
                    case TUESDAY:
                        System.out.println(7);
                        break;
                    case THURSDAY:
                    case SATURDAY:
                        System.out.println(8);
                        break;
                    case WEDNESDAY:
                        System.out.println(9);
                        break;
                }

            It should be possible to say that directly, using a switch expression, which is both clearer and safer:
                int numLetters = switch (day) {
                    case MONDAY, FRIDAY, SUNDAY -> 6;
                    case TUESDAY                -> 7;
                    case THURSDAY, SATURDAY     -> 8;
                    case WEDNESDAY              -> 9;
                };

        This functionality became permanent in jdk14 with some changes:
      !!!   The two statements, break (with or without a label) and yield, facilitate easy disambiguation between
            switch statements and switch expressions: a switch statement but not a switch expression can be the target
            of a break statement; and a switch expression but not a switch statement can be the target of a yield statement.
